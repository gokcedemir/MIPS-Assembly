# MIPS-Assembly
 full assembly program
I write a full assembly program that takes two floating point numbers
and record each as two integer variables before the decimal point and after
the decimal point. This program has two subroutines: add and subtract.
I are not allowed to use floating point instructions. I can
only use integer instructions.
